# Experimental Fortran/C interfaces

This repository contains **experimental** Fortran bindings for various C libraries, automatically generated with the [cfwrapper](https://github.com/vmagnin/gtk-fortran/wiki/How-to-hack-the-cfwrapper) program of the gtk-fortran project. **Do not use for production** (these bindings may be removed if they are finally adopted by an external project). The objective is just to offer raw files to test, which could possibly lead up to the creation of new Fortran libraries.

These interfaces are not 100% complete but if you have written a proof of concept and want to go further, I can try to improve the behavior of the cfwrapper. You can also write by hand the possibly missing crucial interfaces.

These files are under the very flexible [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/). They can therefore be included into a project using another license.

## List of experimental interfaces

- `src/libsoup3/` (HTTP client/server library): generated from `libsoup3-devel` 3.4.2 in Fedora 38. See the [Soup 3.0 documentation](https://libsoup.org/libsoup-3.0/index.html).

- `src/libadwaita/` (Building blocks for modern GNOME applications): generated from `libadwaita-devel` 1.3.3 in Fedora 38. See the [Adwaita documentation](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/).

### List of the files for each library

For each library you will find a batch of files (only the two first files are absolutely needed):

- `\*-auto.f90`: the Fortran module with the interfaces.
- `other_enums-auto.in`: a file with the enums that is included in the module with an `include` statement.
- `interfaces_index.csv`: the list of the generated interfaces.
- `interfaces_types.csv`: the C types used by the cfwrapper.
- `interfaces_funptr.csv`: the function pointers used by the cfwrapper.
- `*.txt`: the statistics output by the cfwrapper.
- `cfwrapper-errors.csv`: useful to understand the problems encountered by the wrapper.

## Interfaces already adopted by a project

These libraries are based on interfaces generated by our cfwrapper:

## Requirements and dependencies

You need:

* a modern Fortran compiler, for example GFortran or the Intel ifort/ifx compilers. See the [Fortran-lang.org compilers page](https://fortran-lang.org/compilers/) for other compilers.
* The development files of the libraries.
* (optional) The Fortran Package Manager [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/). But fpm is optional: you can also just copy the two `.f90` and `.in` files in the directory of your project.

### Installation in Linux

If you have a GitHub account, just clone the repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vmagnin/experimental_interfaces.git
$ cd experimental_interfaces
```

and install the dev files of the library you want to explore.

### Installation in Windows

You can use for example the [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) environment:

* https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-cairo
* https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-fpm

Install the following packages via the MSYS2-MSYS shell:

  * build tools: 
    * `$ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain base-devel` (it will install gcc, gdb, gfortran, python, make, pkgconf...)
  * git: 
    * `$ pacman -S git`
  * Fortran Package Manager fpm: 
    * `$ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-fpm`

and the libraries you want to explore. Then start the MSYS2-UCRT64 shell.

If you have a GitHub account, just clone the repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vmagnin/experimental_interfaces.git
$ cd experimental_interfaces
```

## Testing

```bash
$ fpm test
```

## fpm

To use these interfaces in a fpm project, add the following section to your project `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
experimental_interfaces = {git = "https://github.com/vmagnin/experimental_interfaces" }
```
